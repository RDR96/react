This is an example Next.js app that uses the Mercoa React Component Library

It uses Server Side Rendering to generate the API Token, but you can use a client side API request or any other method to generate the token.

## Running the app

`MERCOA_API_KEY='YOUR API KEY' MERCOA_ENTITY_ID='ent_xxxxx' npm run dev`
